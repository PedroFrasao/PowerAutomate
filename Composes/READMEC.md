Relationship between "Composes" and "HTML":
Each Compose is responsible for replacing data in a specific part of the HTML using Placeholders (words inside {{...}}).

If you want to change the name of a column in a SharePoint list (used in the report), you'll need to update the internal column name. This internal name is used in one of the Compose actions and will automatically replace the corresponding value inside {{...}}.
